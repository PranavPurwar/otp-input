Call the `OTPTextInput` component in your JSX code and pass the required props to customize the OTP input field.

```typescript jsx
import { Platform } from 'react-native';

<OTPTextInput
  inputCount={4}
  tintColor={"#FF6F61"}
  offTintColor={"#BBBCBE"}
  onTextChangeHandler={(pin: string) => {
    console.log('Current OTP:', pin);
  }}
  keyboardType={Platform.OS === 'ios' ? 'number-pad' : 'numeric'}
/>
```
